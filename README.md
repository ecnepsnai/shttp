# shttp

Have you ever thought: Golly gee, HTTP is great and all, but wouldn't it be even better if it were a little less
insecure?

Well do I have good news for you! The wait is finally over! Behold, **Secure** HTTP!

That's right, now you can browse the web in absolute safety with this one simply trick certificate authroties don't
want you to know about!

shttp, it's HTTP over SSH!

## But what about HTTPS?

Sorry, could you speak up a little? HTTPS? Never heard of it. Sounds fake. Probably made up.

## Okay, but like seriously, why?

Mostly to demonstrate the flexability of the SSH protocol and for a laugh.

I feel that last bit bares clarifiation: **This is a joke. A gag. Just for fun.**

## Great, can I use this in my next big thing?

No, you shouldn't use this. Not only is it highly impratical, it's probably not actually secure.
